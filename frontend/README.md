# Frontend for Spoti.fish

## Development hints

- When the spotify api mode is set to "development" [e.g. here](./.env.development) the [Spotify App Authorization Key](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)
can be set using another .env file (preferably a local env file that won't be commited) using the key `VUE_APP_SPOTIFY_API_KEY`.
